# Arithmetic Circuits

This folder contains Verilog implementations of fundamental arithmetic circuits.

## Projects

- **full_adder.v** — Single bit full adder  
- **half_adder.v** — Single bit half adder  
- **4_bit_adder.v** — 4-bit ripple carry adder  
- **subtractor.v** — Single bit subtractor  

## Testbenches

Testbenches are located in the `testbenches/` folder. Use these to verify the functionality of the designs.

## Simulation

To run simulations, use ModelSim or QuestaSim with the provided testbenches.
